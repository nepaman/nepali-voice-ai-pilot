# Nepali Voice AI – Pilot Project

## Overview
Nepali Voice AI is a personal pilot project focused on building a basic **Speech-to-Text (STT)** and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** system for everyday Nepali conversations.

The goal of this project is to improve **Nepali language representation in voice-based AI systems**, using open-source tools and a realistic, learning-first approach.

This is a **non-commercial pilot project**, developed by a single contributor, with long-term community impact in mind.

## Project Goals
- Build a working Nepali Speech-to-Text (STT) prototype
- Build a natural Nepali Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice
- Focus on daily, conversational Nepali (not formal or literary)
- Learn and document the AI development process
- Create a foundation that can scale with community contributions

---

## Scope (Pilot Phase)
### Included
- Single-speaker voice dataset
- Basic STT and TTS models
- Simple demo (local or web-based)

### Not Included
- Commercial deployment
- Mobile applications
- Multi-speaker or multi-accent support (for now)
