## Week 0: Project Reset & Foundation

### Day 1 - January 23, 2026

**Today's Goal:**
- Understand project reset rationale
- Review new documentation structure
- Commit to new direction

**What I Did:**
- Read complete project reset document
- Discussed strategy pivot with Claude
- Reviewed both STT-first and TTS-first approaches
- Decided to follow STT-first approach

**What I Learned:**
- STT-first is more practical for solo learning
- Multilingual issue with Whisper is easily fixable with `language="ne"` parameter
- Quick wins are important for maintaining motivation
- Documentation is as important as code

**Challenges:**
- Letting go of TTS-first approach I was committed to
- Understanding why this pivot makes sense

**Solutions/Decisions:**
- Trust the technical analysis
- Focus on getting something working quickly
- Can still do custom TTS later with proper foundation

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
- Set up development environment
- Install Python and verify
- Install Git and configure
- Create project folder structure

**Time Spent:** 2 hours
**Mood/Energy:** 😊 Motivated and clear on direction
